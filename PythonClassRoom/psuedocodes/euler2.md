# Euler Problem-2

```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
```

## Psuedo Code
1. sum = 2
2. a = 1
3.  b = 2
4. repeat until b <= 4000000
5.  c = a+b
6.  if c%2 equals 0 then sum = sum + c
7.  a = b
8.  b = c
9.  go to step 4
